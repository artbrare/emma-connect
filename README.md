# Emma Connect

## What is this?
Emma Connect is my attempt at building a personal assistant that actually understands what you need. It handles your money, tracks your food, manages your schedule, and you can talk to it through WhatsApp.

## Why Emma?
Because every good assistant needs a name, and Emma sounds friendly enough to handle your daily chaos.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** TanStack Start + React + TypeScript
- **UI:** Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** Convex (real-time magic)
- **Auth:** Clerk (because auth is hard)
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Smart stuff:** WhatsApp integration + Claude AI

## Features I'm Building
- [ ] Finance tracking that doesn't suck
- [ ] Calorie counter (without the judgment)
- [ ] Calendar that actually helps
- [ ] WhatsApp integration for lazy people
- [ ] AI that gets you
